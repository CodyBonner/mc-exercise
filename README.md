**What this lab is about.**

This lab is about working together and finding each others strengths and weaknesses when working as a group.

One of the things that went wrong was Bob & Carol did not do a git pull origin main. Without doing a git pull origin main they did not have the updated main file. Following changes could have been effected by not having original file data. 

Originally we neglected to set up the protection for the main repo resulting in unauthorized pull merges that could have effected main code.

Carol failed to use proper naming conventions between branch and file names.

Alice found personal struggle utilizing a-c-p functionality. 
Will work towardsmore efficient methods in future projects.
